# English Dictionary

#### I created the project using the API with fetch() method of Javascript. 

At first, I got the user searched input, and then using the fetch API method I sent a get request to an API (dictionaryapi.dev) with passing the user searched word.
If the searched word exists then API returns an object of the searched word which holds many details (**definition, example, synonyms**) of the word else it returns a message of “Can’t find the definitions”. Once I fetched the data from API then I inserted each data into a particular HTML element.

## To create this project, one needs to create three files:
* HTML

    * index.html
* CSS

  * style.css
* JavaScript

   * script.js
   
 
###### First, create an HTML file with the name of index.html and paste the given codes in the github repository in your HTML file. Remember, you’ve to create a file with .html extension.

###### Second, create a CSS file with the name of style.css and paste the given codes in the github repository in your CSS file. Remember, you’ve to create a file with .css extension.

###### Last, create a JavaScript file with the name of script.js and paste the given codes in the github repository in your JavaScript file. Remember, you’ve to create a file with .js extension.


###### That’s all, now you’ve successfully built an English Dictionary App in HTML CSS & JavaScript. If your code doesn’t work or you’ve faced any error/problem, you can clone or fork the repository on your version control.

### This project is based on API but you don’t need to signup anywhere and pass the API key to use this dictionary app. I have used the free API (dictionaryapi.dev) for this project and to use this API there is no need for signup or API key.
